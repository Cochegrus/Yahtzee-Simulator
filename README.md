# Yahtzee-Simulator
A text-based game to play Yahtzee between any number of human and/or computer players.

This was simply a self-imposed challenge to see if I could create a form of rudimentary "ai" that performed consistently well without relying heavily on luck or user input. While I suspect certain bits of the algorithm are never reached, the computer player obtains somewhere around of 170 points every game. Further optimization might make it possible for the computer to score higher, but I think this is a decent level for the computer as it is difficult enough to pose a challenge without being unbeatable.

There is also currently an issue that arises when you try to play again with the same players. I will look to update this sometime during the summer to ensure easy playability.

The file that runs the main function is "YahtzeeSim.java".

Feel free to take any of my code and adapt it for practice. I doubt any of it could get licensed without getting rid of all Yahtzee references.
